let a = 10;
let b = 10;

console.log(" The total price is : " , a + b , "rupees. ");

// alternative
let output = "The total price is " + ( a + b ) + " rupees ";

here we used bracket nhi to wo string samajh ke add ho jaate hi , ab pehle calculate honge phir string samajh ke add honge.




// Best way is literals
They are used to add embedded expression in a string.

let output = `The total price is ${ a + b }   ruppes. ";
