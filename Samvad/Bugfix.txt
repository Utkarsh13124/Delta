Main Collaboration Flow:

Permission → Connection → Streaming: The app first gets media permissions, then connects to signaling server, then establishes peer-to-peer connections
State-Driven Media: React state changes trigger media operations through useEffect hooks, keeping UI and media in sync
Peer-to-Peer Architecture: After initial signaling, video/audio flows directly between browsers (not through server)
