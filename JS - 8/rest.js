        What is relation between rest and spread.
        ye functions ke saath hi use hota hi kya ? 
        iska need kyu tha?
        suntax same kyu hi?

        argument keyword within function 
        iska need kyu tha , kyu bnaya gya ise?
    !!
        rest allows a function to take indefinite argument..
        like min function is taking lot of argument.

        argument :- sare argument ka colection hota hi , 
            aur ye hr ek function ke liye  hota hi.

            but it is not a array so we cannot use function like reduce , push or others.

        so here rest is useful , we can rreceive each argument with help of rest operator which makes arrray.
            and can perform most of operation.
    !!!

        if we want to send more argument then we need to write them before rest.
