form ke ander agar humne posts method define kr rakha hi, to wo ssubmit krne pr ek post request dega , to action link.


fetching value , 
let {id} = req.params;
        console.log(id); // a1

Although UUID gives a unique id 
    which have  very less chance for repetetion , 340 undecillion

    but if we want to be highly certain about id , we could use timestamp + system Information
