/*
    require vs import 
        require krne se wo package ya file aati hi
        but import krne se hum kisi piece of code ko bhi import kr sakte hi. 


    good practice is to either use require or import.

        export item from source
        recieve at destination 
            import {sum , PI} from "./math2.js";
            we also need to name the extension properly. 


             but for import few other steps we also need to follow
                creating package.json file
                and usme type ko as a module define krna hota hi.
                    "type" : "module"
                
        similarly we can import from package just like we do from files., just we have to install the packages.
